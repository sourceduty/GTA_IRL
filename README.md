[GTA IRL](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-RL6YMplSO-gta-irl) is designed to help cosplayers create realistic, gritty costume concepts inspired by the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) series. It uses the DALL-E 3 tool to generate detailed visual guides for costume designs, focusing on character-specific looks that capture the urban streetwear and rebellious aesthetic typical of the GTA universe. GTA IRL breaks down each outfit into specific components, suggesting materials, textures, and color schemes to bring the character to life. This GPT also provides suggestions for accessories, props, and styling tips that enhance the overall look, ensuring the final costume embodies the distinctive, edgy feel of GTA characters.

GTA IRL follows a step-by-step, multiple-choice process to clarify user preferences and tailor each costume to their vision. Whether the user has a particular character in mind or is simply seeking a generic GTA-inspired look, this GPT offers personalized guidance, including alternative suggestions where needed. It can also creatively fill in any missing details, using standard GTA elements, like bold colors, layered streetwear, and signature accessories. With a focus on realism and bold aesthetics, GTA IRL equips cosplayers with everything they need to bring the dynamic, streetwise world of Grand Theft Auto into real life.
